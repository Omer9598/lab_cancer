In this file we will explain what we did in the lab so far and
the difficulties on the way


Main goal:
filter non-relevant variants in cancer patients DNA sequencing


Approach:
comparing the haplotype inheritance in different families.
This way, we will only consider the variants in the areas where all the siblings/ children
have the same haplotype.
For example, say we have 3 cancer patients - a mother and her 2 children.
For simplicity, we will focus on chromosome 13 (chosen arbitrary).
Now, say that child 1 inherited haplotype 1 from position 1 to 30M in chromosome 13,
and inherited haplotype 2 from position 30M to the end of the chromosome (due to recombination)
In addition, child 2 inherited haplotype 2 from position 1 to 15M, and from position 35M to the
end of the chromosome, and inherited haplotype 1 from position 15M to 35M.
We want to create an algorithm that filters the chromosomes such that it will show us the
common haplotype inheritance - where in the example above, this area (in chromosome 13 as
mentioned), is from positions:
15M-30M for haplotype 1
35M-end of chromosome for haplotype 2.


Problems & Solutions:

Problem - the information regarding the haplotype inheritance can be mixed - the haplotype order
can be inverted in the given file, although in reality the haplotype shouldn't be inverted (there
was no recombination).
Solution - taking one of the patients, and assuming that the reference patient inherited one of
the haplotypes (in our case - haplotype 1). Afterward, inverting the reference patient's
information on haplotypes, such that it will be seen as the reference actually inherited only
haplotype 1 to one of the patients in his family. Then, we find the haplotype inheritance of all
the other cancer patients in the family, and compare the results.
What we will see - only the parts of the chromosome (haplotypes) that all the patients share.

Problem - the sequenced patients in some families are siblings and not mother-children, we don't
have a reference genome to compare haplotypes.
Solution - picking one of the siblings arbitrary as reference. In addition, we can change the
referenced sibling if needed.
